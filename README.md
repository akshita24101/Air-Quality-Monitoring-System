# Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
A real-time indoor air monitoring system built using Arduino. It measures temperature, humidity, and gas concentration using DHT11 and MQ-135 sensors. The system displays the values on an LCD screen and uses an LED to indicate air quality levels. An IR remote allows switching between display modes for better usability.
